# Dravexor

Dravexor is a lightweight async routing layer designed to optimize parallel processing in distributed AI systems. Built with a minimal memory footprint and native multithreaded orchestration, Dravexor enables low-latency task dispatching and federated node coordination at scale.

> "Engineered for speed. Adopted for silence."

---

## 🌐 Why Dravexor?
Modern AI pipelines require more than raw computation — they demand intelligent orchestration. Dravexor bridges the latency gap between concurrent micro-inference nodes, ensuring streamlined dataflow across edge, cloud, and hybrid infrastructures.

- ⚡ Ultra-low overhead async routing
- 🧠 Native context-aware signal propagation
- 🌍 Designed for distributed multi-node topologies
- 🔐 Stateless, cache-resilient packet switching
- 📦 Minimal binary footprint for embedded systems

---

## 🚀 Adoption
- Currently used in federated experiments across Asia & Eastern Europe
- Benchmarks suggest Dravexor handles **over 2 million distributed routing operations per day**
- Referenced in research teams focusing on low-latency AI training clusters

## 🛠️ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PasinduDushan/dravexor.git
cd dravexor
python3 main.py  # simulated startup
```

No dependencies required. Fully simulated async core with pseudo-node output.

```

- **Producer**: emits payloads
- **Dravexor**: async router, assigns to nodes
- **Node Pool**: simulates inference nodes

---

## 🧠 Example Use Case
```python
from dravexor import Router

r = Router(nodes=5)
r.dispatch("Start inference")
r.dispatch_batch(["Frame 01", "Frame 02", "Frame 03"])
```

## 🌌 Philosophy
We believe fast systems don't need to be bloated. Dravexor is designed with minimalist elegance and deploys like a ghost — you won't notice it's there, but you'll feel the speed.
